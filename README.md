# ðŸ’¬ Social Media Comment Control

## Problem
The rapid increase in social media usage and the number of content creators has brought about new mental health concerns. Among these, one significant issue is the impact of hate comments, which can lead to discouragement, anxiety, and depression in creators. Our goal is to specifically address the mental health strain resulting from harmful comments left on creators' content.

## Solution: 
Our primary solution is to develop a system using Open AI that detects and captures hate comments immediately upon posting. By archiving these comments before the creator sees them, we aim to shield them from direct exposure to negativity.
